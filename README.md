# **Overview of analysis of sales data**

This dataset encompasses the comprehensive sales history of various product categories across the United States from 2014 to 2017. The objective of this analysis is to identify critical insights that will enhance sales performance and profit margins.
The dataset has been collected from Kaggle.

## **Key findings:** 
1. The overall sales increases across the years
2. There is a direct correlation between profit and discount. While a 0% discount yields the highest profit, a 20% discount also results in a substantial profit. Discounts either above or below this percentage lead to a decline in profit margins.
3. Despite having fewer sub-categories, the technology category generates the highest profit, followed by the office supply category.
4.  Sales rep Anna Andreadi made the highest sales, achieving more than 90% of the target.
